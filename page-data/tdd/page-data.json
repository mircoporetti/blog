Only later did I read the book ‚ÄúTDD by example‚Äù by Kent Beck.</p>\n<p>I started putting it into practice at work 4 years ago, thanks also to some more experienced colleagues and\nto our constant desire to grow together.</p>\n<p>I think that practicing TDD is a process that requires continuous practical experience and I feel that every\nday I can still learn something about that.</p>\n<h4>Why I like it</h4>\n<p>Why do I like Test Driven Development?\nHere is some reason:</p>\n<h6>Incremental and small iterations</h6>\n<p>TDD lets the design emerge exploring a problem iteratively and incrementally. That‚Äôs an important aspect that helps me\nin tackling the problems without overthinking the final solution especially when they are complex.\nFurthermore, it helps me focus on a single problem at a time.</p>\n<h6>Simplicity and focus on requirements</h6>\n<p>It takes me on the right track to build a simpler design, write more maintainable code and more essential\nand useful tests that match the business requirements without necessarily being interested in how every single component\nis built internally.</p>\n<p>About this point, just comes to my mind a task that we did on a project.\nWe noticed an improper use of domain objects. They were used simply as data containers and the critical domain\nlogic was implemented into many services that used those data, forgetting about object-oriented essence.\nFor getting rid of such anemic usage of objects we decided to refactor a bit and as a first step, we wrote some tests for the\nexisting use-cases, inferring the requirements from the existing code and focusing on the input and the output of the problem\nwithout caring about every internal class.\nIn this way, the first tests became our requirements, and they were our source of feedback for a safe refactoring of the domain logic.\nProceeding with the refactoring we added other tests that were useful also for the new design of the code that, of course, can change based on personal experience and knowledge,\nbut we were sure that in any case, it couldn‚Äôt be that bad! üòÑ</p>\n<p>What does TDD have to do with it?\nWe did it as we would do it without having an existing code. We did it as we would do it with a Test Driven approach,\nand that helped a lot!</p>\n<h6>Different mindset</h6>\n<p>Dealing with legacy code is common. It happened sometimes that I wanted to write tests for it and while doing that\nthere was some difficulty due to the existing design of the code. That‚Äôs usually a hint that something has to be changed.\nAn example of a recurrent scenario in my experience is when I met a poor separation between the infrastructure (e.g. persistence)\nand the domain that was evidenced by an impossibility in writing simple, clear, and ‚Äúnot frustrating‚Äù tests.\nThat lack of separation of responsibility resulted in tests that were long and full of mocks. So what was it telling me?</p>\n<p>REFACTOOOOR!</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 2996px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/blog/static/dfdf2629b3aaf1117e27c0434598f920/cc6de/hammer.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 58.24%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/blog/static/dfdf2629b3aaf1117e27c0434598f920/2899c/hammer.webp 1250w,\n/blog/static/dfdf2629b3aaf1117e27c0434598f920/a3bc4/hammer.webp 2500w,\n/blog/static/dfdf2629b3aaf1117e27c0434598f920/aa4b5/hammer.webp 2996w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 2996px) 100vw, 2996px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/blog/static/dfdf2629b3aaf1117e27c0434598f920/76902/hammer.jpg 1250w,\n/blog/static/dfdf2629b3aaf1117e27c0434598f920/44ecf/hammer.jpg 2500w,\n/blog/static/dfdf2629b3aaf1117e27c0434598f920/cc6de/hammer.jpg 2996w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 2996px) 100vw, 2996px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/blog/static/dfdf2629b3aaf1117e27c0434598f920/cc6de/hammer.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Figure 2\"\n            title=\"Refactoring\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>TDD is a tool that gives us feedback on the quality of the design.\nThe example above was not directly related to it but having some experience with this approach can change your way of thinking\nand it can be exploited for recognizing smells when you need to write tests on an existing codebase because if the design\nis poor the tests will be difficult to write (and vice versa). If that happens it will be the right moment to refactor!\nThat‚Äôs super cool but pay attention: if you don‚Äôt do it from that moment you become an accomplice. üòâ</p>\n<h4>Mocks</h4>\n<p>Mocks are a powerful tool used for controlling the behavior of a component inside your test. They are helpful in some\nsituations but they can be abused and become a smell. When the test is full of mocks probably the design is poor. If I\nthink about the reasons I recognize mainly 2 scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Even if you practice TDD you can fall into the trap of thinking about the structure of the modules before or while\nwriting the test. This is a common mistake and I think that 99% of devs experience it at some point, especially at the\nstart of the learning process;</li>\n<li>Mocks are often a way to be able to write tests on an already existing poor design without spending time on refactoring.\nIf you focus on requirements and not on classes when writing tests, likely you will tend to mock less.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I often mock boundaries if needed, mainly when I‚Äôm specifically testing the domain of the problem which requires\ninteractions with the infrastructure.</p>\n<h4>Outside in vs Inside out</h4>\n<p>There is an endless debate on starting from the outside or the inside when you start your TDD cycle.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 2995px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/blog/static/281736d9cfc447ccc28001acb166ffee/18cf4/gladiators.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 58.24%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/blog/static/281736d9cfc447ccc28001acb166ffee/2899c/gladiators.webp 1250w,\n/blog/static/281736d9cfc447ccc28001acb166ffee/a3bc4/gladiators.webp 2500w,\n/blog/static/281736d9cfc447ccc28001acb166ffee/0907a/gladiators.webp 2995w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 2995px) 100vw, 2995px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/blog/static/281736d9cfc447ccc28001acb166ffee/76902/gladiators.jpg 1250w,\n/blog/static/281736d9cfc447ccc28001acb166ffee/44ecf/gladiators.jpg 2500w,\n/blog/static/281736d9cfc447ccc28001acb166ffee/18cf4/gladiators.jpg 2995w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 2995px) 100vw, 2995px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/blog/static/281736d9cfc447ccc28001acb166ffee/18cf4/gladiators.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Figure 3\"\n            title=\"Outside in vs Inside out\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Kent Beck wrote something like this: ‚ÄúChoose a test that teaches you something valuable and that you can write‚Äù.\nA good idea could be to start from the most obscure and valuable part of the problem because it‚Äôs probably the one\nthat will have more value for solving your problem.\nThat‚Äôs not a fixed rule but a general suggestion and the right approach can be chosen depending on the situation.</p>\n<p>‚Äú‚Ä¶yes yes but what about you in practice?‚Äù</p>\n<p>I usually go Outside In, and then I jump into more detailed tests based on the complexity of the problem but\nit happens that I start from inside if I recognize that there is a clear aspect of the problem that is more complex.</p>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>TDD helps you in building a simpler design and more maintainable code. It doesn‚Äôt mean that being driven by the tests carries\nyou to a specific design.\nIn the end, YOU are responsible for a better design but this approach gives you a natural push towards the right path and what will\nemerge at the end will be for sure something better, cleaner, SOLID, and so on üòÑ</p>\n<p>Even if you won‚Äôt use TDD as your ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù approach, having some experience with it will help you in making better\ndecisions when you have to do that in your daily work. It will help you in recognizing smells and it will change your way\nof dealing with a problem during development.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>References:</h4>\n<p>TDD by Example , XP Explained, <a href=\"https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/10/WhenToMock.html\">When to Mock</a>,\n<a href=\"https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/03/03/TDD-Harms-Architecture.html#:~:text=Yes!,architecture%20%E2%80%93%20TDD%20or%20no%20TDD\">TDD Harms Architecture</a></p>\n<h6>Credits:</h6>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:0.7em;\"><a href=\"https://de.freepik.com/vektoren-kostenlos/zwei-bewaffnete-gladiatoren-die-cartoon-kompositionsvektorillustration-bekaempfen_23579801.htm#query=rome%20war&#x26;position=7&#x26;from_view=search\">Image by macrovector from Freepik</a></span><br>\n<span style=\"font-size:0.7em;\"><a href=\"https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/angry-business-person-breaking-office-computer-with-big-hammer_20827534.htm#query=destroy&#x26;position=0&#x26;from_view=search\">Image by pch.vector from Freepik</a></span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"TDD Who?","date":"September 18, 2022","description":"What's Test Driven Development and Why every developer should experience it?"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/deploying-my-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deploying my blog using Gatsby and Github Pages"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"54852ce6-2757-5ea1-89dd-66772d5eb817","previousPostId":"aefa7883-b930-5bf5-b3e3-4bb4b0e0d489","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
