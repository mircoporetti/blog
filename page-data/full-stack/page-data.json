But what does often happen after some time?<br />\nAs the applications grow, there will be more functionalities, many of them will change, and the complexity will change.\nThe initial choice will become probably a costly choice in the future because each part of the system was designed with\nless experience and care compared to what a specialised engineer would have.</p>\n<p>It’s a quality choice, and the lack of quality of a product will make its maintenance and its evolution more expensive in the future.</p>\n<p>When a company only hires “Full Stack Engineers”, I hear a bell ringing right away. <br />\nAt least it is worth asking a few questions about the reasons behind the choice. 😄</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I believe in focusing on a field with the attitude to develop other skills as an added value,\nnot in knowing everything superficially without clear goals.</p>\n<p>I believe in “Full Stack skills” as something that completes you, not in Full Stack Engineering as an all-in-one field or\nas a role.</p>\n<h6>Credits:</h6>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:0.7em;\"><a href=\"https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/man-who-thinks-idea-is-admired-by-thumbs-up_11879378.htm#query=good&#x26;from_query=I%20m%20good&#x26;position=4&#x26;from_view=search&#x26;track=sph\">Image by jcomp from Freepik</a></span></br>\n<span style=\"font-size:0.7em;\"><a href=\"https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/concentration-focus-business-goal-target-business-goal-solution-concept_20822842.htm#query=focus&#x26;position=4&#x26;from_view=search&#x26;track=sph\">Image by jcomp from Freepik</a></span></br>\n<span style=\"font-size:0.7em;\"><a href=\"https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/programmer-working-isometric-style_4911005.htm#query=software%20engineer&#x26;position=27&#x26;from_view=search&#x26;track=sph\">Image by pikisuperstar from Freepik</a></span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I believe in Full Stack skills, not in Full Stack Engineering","date":"October 09, 2022","description":"There is a lot of hype around Full Stack Engineering today.
