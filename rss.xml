&lt;p&gt;First, let’s try to give a couple of basic and simplified definitions of what is meant by Tech Stack and Full Stack Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “Tech stack” is a set of technologies used together to build a software product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Full Stack Engineer could be defined in many ways but nowadays, the term is commonly referred to as an engineer
who has enough knowledge and experience to efficiently work on the entire stack of an application,
from Frontend to Backend and Infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago there wasn’t a real distinction between Frontend, Backend, or whatever engineers: they were simply Software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

          /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last decades, the “Full Stack Engineer” term became popular thanks also to some web development technologies and
their stacks that became mainstream, like LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySql, Php) or MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJs, Node.js)
which contributed to the reunification of the role in the business world.
MEAN stack had a relevant role: both Backend and Frontend developers could start to work on the other side using the same
programming language (in this case Javascript, and Typescript later). Its popularity put even more emphasis on the term “Stack”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve given a bit of an overview of Full Stack’s common meaning, let’s go gradually to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Versatility is a skill, not a requirement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, it’s appreciated to have knowledge for being able to touch different parts of the systems, the so-called Full Stack skills,
and it’s definitely something important because you can help your team in many ways, and you can better understand the
entire cycle of your product having a more clear picture of the processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway being a good developer isn’t a synonym for “Developer who knows everything”. &lt;br /&gt;
Who decides if you are a good developer? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could work on Frontend, Backend, or Infrastructure without being involved in the others branches of engineering,
excelling in your specific field. Wouldn’t you be good enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s my honest and personal opinion: an engineer who is great in his/her field without a lot of knowledge of the others
is not better than an Engineer who can touch everything but with mediocre skills in everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all about QUALITY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The importance of focusing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been a Backend person since university.
The first time I touched a Frontend framework during my first working experience I started to have an interest in Front End
development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that period I felt like someone that is looking for a certain genre of movie to watch on his favorite streaming platform,
and scrolling through the list he changes continuously idea being temporary attracted by the proposals but every time not enough
for clicking the play button.
Every time I started to go deeper into a technology, a type of architecture, or whatever there was something else fascinating that
kept my attention, and I changed my plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my study time, I was confused about what to study and after finishing a course or some basic beginner project
I jumped to another topic that often wasn’t even much related.&lt;br /&gt;
I didn’t go into every topic well because I was more interested in knowing a bit of everything.
That’s perfect for learning many things, but I noticed that I was struggling to keep up with the technologies, concepts,
approaches, etc. in every single sector, and you know… our field is huge, full of new technologies that are born every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s quite impossible to be a person who knows everything really well.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not saying that no one can do it: for sure
the Diego Armando Maradona or the Einstein of the situation exists in every field, but it’s not the rule!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Focus, Focus… Focus!”&lt;/h3&gt;

          /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided at a certain point to focus more on what I liked and that was more akin to my attitude, and Backend, without
precluding the joy of learning and touching also Frontend, DevOps stuff, and so on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going on with this approach even today.&lt;br /&gt;
At this specific period for example I’m learning a lot of “DevOps-related things” and sometimes even some Frontend concept
working with my Team thanks also to more expert colleagues in those fields, but I continue to consider myself a
“Software Engineer focused on the Backend dark side with a strong interest in learning even non-Backend things when useful
and possible” but with clear priorities 😄.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on something and setting yourself clear goals is the best way to improve the quality of what you do
because investing more time in it will allow you to build your experience on what you choose, improving day by day and
keeping up with its evolution. &lt;br /&gt;
This is not valid only in Software Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are even able to improve in other fields is for sure a great value, but it should be considered a plus that makes you more
flexible and valuable, not the main goal that makes you lose your specialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what’s the problem behind Full Stack Engineering?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is not the person’s interest in being more versatile, but it’s the companies’ approach to that, which
leads developers to think that the important thing is to know a little of everything, for being more desirable on the market,
losing the focus on their own specialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happens that Companies look for Full Stack Engineers, in order to hire fewer people who will have more responsibilities in different
parts of the system.
Sometimes they give less importance to one role over another, underestimating the impact of not having specialised people on the product.
The reason is quite simple: it’s cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s true, that’s an economical advantage initially. But what does often happen after some time?&lt;br /&gt;
As the applications grow, there will be more functionalities, many of them will change, and the complexity will change.
The initial choice will become probably a costly choice in the future because each part of the system was designed with
less experience and care compared to what a specialised engineer would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a quality choice, and the lack of quality of a product will make its maintenance and its evolution more expensive in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a company only hires “Full Stack Engineers”, I hear a bell ringing right away. &lt;br /&gt;
At least it is worth asking a few questions about the reasons behind the choice. 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in focusing on a field with the attitude to develop other skills as an added value,
not in knowing everything superficially without clear goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in “Full Stack skills” as something that completes you, not in Full Stack Engineering as an all-in-one field or
as a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDD is an approach for driving development by testing with the goal of a clean and simple design. While practicing TDD
the focus is on the requirements. It’s about development and design, not simply testing or coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a crucial point that in my opinion makes Test Driven Development   different and more valuable than generic
“Test First”: TDD is an iterative process but also a mental different way to think about the problems,
based on needs not on already thought solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every iteration could be described as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RED: Write a test that fails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GREEN: Create the minimum code to make it pass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;REFACTOR: Remove duplication and improve your code without changing its behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How tests should be?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some popular characters (one for all Kent Beck, author of TDD by Example) expressed some rules about how tests should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Express intent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to understand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on business requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests not coupled with production code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One problem for every broken test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My little journey with TDD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first meeting with Test Driven Development was in 2017 when I started getting interested in the topic after reading
some articles and following some conferences. Only later did I read the book “TDD by example” by Kent Beck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started putting it into practice at work 4 years ago, thanks also to some more experienced colleagues and
to our constant desire to grow together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that practicing TDD is a process that requires continuous practical experience and I feel that every
day I can still learn something about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why I like it&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I like Test Driven Development?
Here is some reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incremental and small iterations&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDD lets the design emerge exploring a problem iteratively and incrementally. That’s an important aspect that helps me
in tackling the problems without overthinking the final solution especially when they are complex.
Furthermore, it helps me focus on a single problem at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Simplicity and focus on requirements&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes me on the right track to build a simpler design, write more maintainable code and more essential
and useful tests that match the business requirements without necessarily being interested in how every single component
is built internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About this point, just comes to my mind a task that we did on a project.
We noticed an improper use of domain objects. They were used simply as data containers and the critical domain
logic was implemented into many services that used those data, forgetting about object-oriented essence.
For getting rid of such anemic usage of objects we decided to refactor a bit and as a first step, we wrote some tests for the
existing use-cases, inferring the requirements from the existing code and focusing on the input and the output of the problem
without caring about every internal class.
In this way, the first tests became our requirements, and they were our source of feedback for a safe refactoring of the domain logic.
Proceeding with the refactoring we added other tests that were useful also for the new design of the code that, of course, can change based on personal experience and knowledge,
but we were sure that in any case, it couldn’t be that bad! 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does TDD have to do with it?
We did it as we would do it without having an existing code. We did it as we would do it with a Test Driven approach,
and that helped a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Different mindset&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with legacy code is common. It happened sometimes that I wanted to write tests for it and while doing that
there was some difficulty due to the existing design of the code. That’s usually a hint that something has to be changed.
An example of a recurrent scenario in my experience is when I met a poor separation between the infrastructure (e.g. persistence)
and the domain that was evidenced by an impossibility in writing simple, clear, and “not frustrating” tests.
That lack of separation of responsibility resulted in tests that were long and full of mocks. So what was it telling me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REFACTOOOOR!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDD is a tool that gives us feedback on the quality of the design.
The example above was not directly related to it but having some experience with this approach can change your way of thinking
and it can be exploited for recognizing smells when you need to write tests on an existing codebase because if the design
is poor the tests will be difficult to write (and vice versa). If that happens it will be the right moment to refactor!
That’s super cool but pay attention: if you don’t do it from that moment you become an accomplice. 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mocks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mocks are a powerful tool used for controlling the behavior of a component inside your test. They are helpful in some
situations but they can be abused and become a smell. When the test is full of mocks probably the design is poor. If I
think about the reasons I recognize mainly 2 scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if you practice TDD you can fall into the trap of thinking about the structure of the modules before or while
writing the test. This is a common mistake and I think that 99% of devs experience it at some point, especially at the
start of the learning process;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mocks are often a way to be able to write tests on an already existing poor design without spending time on refactoring.
If you focus on requirements and not on classes when writing tests, likely you will tend to mock less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often mock boundaries if needed, mainly when I’m specifically testing the domain of the problem which requires
interactions with the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Outside in vs Inside out&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an endless debate on starting from the outside or the inside when you start your TDD cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent Beck wrote something like this: “Choose a test that teaches you something valuable and that you can write”.
A good idea could be to start from the most obscure and valuable part of the problem because it’s probably the one
that will have more value for solving your problem.
That’s not a fixed rule but a general suggestion and the right approach can be chosen depending on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…yes yes but what about you in practice?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually go Outside In, and then I jump into more detailed tests based on the complexity of the problem but
it happens that I start from inside if I recognize that there is a clear aspect of the problem that is more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDD helps you in building a simpler design and more maintainable code. It doesn’t mean that being driven by the tests carries
you to a specific design.
In the end, YOU are responsible for a better design but this approach gives you a natural push towards the right path and what will
emerge at the end will be for sure something better, cleaner, SOLID, and so on 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you won’t use TDD as your “go-to” approach, having some experience with it will help you in making better
decisions when you have to do that in your daily work. It will help you in recognizing smells and it will change your way
of dealing with a problem during development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been interested in improving my knowledge. I usually try to accomplish that following talks, discussing  opinions with friends and colleagues or reading stuff on the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few months often happened, during those situations or simply while working, to think something like “Hey man! You shouldn’t forget this! It would be cool even to share this with someone that could give you another point of view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can always share with people directly or through Social Networks but it’s not so easy to consult again very old things. And of course we have our brain to store info but mine is not the most reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly I was looking also for something to improve my writing.
So what about a blog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gatsby&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set some requirement for choosing the right tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal and ready to use;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customisable without too much effort;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy deployable (and for free?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some research and comparison with others similar tools I found Gatsby!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the official website Gatsby is “A full-stack frontend framework that comes with everything you need out of the box.”
One of the major points for me was that it’s based on ReactJs which I already had some minimal experience with.
Another important point was the existence of ready to use templates for building simple blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Perfect then! And What about Deploy?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea was to reuse my existing custom domain (used for my personal website &lt;a href=&quot;https://mircoporetti.me&quot;&gt;https://mircoporetti.me&lt;/a&gt;) and to make the blog accessible under the subpath/blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the website mentioned above was already deployed using Github Pages, the most natural choice was doing the same for the Gatsby app.
As I will describe in the next section, it was really easy to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Install Nodejs, npm and Gatsby CLI&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install Node and npm from &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/download/&quot;&gt;https://nodejs.org/en/download/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; gatsby-cli&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Create the application&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project I used a very simple blog template called  “gatsby-starter-blog”.
Source and info here &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog&quot;&gt;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the app executing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;gatsby new blog-name https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and run it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; blog-name/
gatsby develop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looked easy! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deploy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to reach the website under domain/blog, Github Pages requires that the Github repository is created with the same name of the subpath, in my case it was “blog”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, go to the “Repositories” section on Github, click on “New” and create a public repo called “blog”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gatsby configuration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add Github Pages dependency:
npm install gh-pages —save-dev&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following script into the package.json:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;deploy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;gatsby build --prefix-paths &amp;amp;&amp;amp; gh-pages -d public&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“deploy”: “gatsby build —prefix-paths &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; gh-pages -d public”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After committing and pushing the changes to the main branch, create another branch called “gh-pages” and push it too.
Go to the Github repository’s settings through Settings-&gt;Pages and set the gh-pages branch as source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: The custom domain doesn’t need to be set here since our page will be automatically published as a subpage of  the domain of the repository deployed under the root / using the repo name “yourGithubName.github.io”.
If the main app has a custom domain configured, the blog app will be under “customDomain/blog”, in my case “mircoporetti.me/blog”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit gatsby-config.js file and add the following line into “module.exports”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;pathPrefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/blog&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you receive an error about parallel queries, add even:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;flags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;PARALLEL_QUERY_RUNNING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Do it! Now!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run the deploy script type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; run deploy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
