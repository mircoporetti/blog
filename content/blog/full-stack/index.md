be a problem."

## Full Stack Engineering

First, let's try to give a couple of basic and simplified definitions of what is meant by Tech Stack and Full Stack Engineer.

A "Tech stack" is a set of technologies used together to build a software product.

A Full Stack Engineer could be defined in many ways but nowadays, the term is commonly referred to as an engineer
who has enough knowledge and experience to efficiently work on the entire stack of an application,
from Frontend to Backend and Infrastructure.

### Origins

Years ago there wasn't a real distinction between Frontend, Backend, or whatever engineers: they were simply Software engineers.

In the last decades, the "Full Stack Engineer" term became popular thanks also to some web development technologies and
their stacks that became mainstream, like LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySql, Php) or MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJs, Node.js)
which contributed to the reunification of the role in the business world.
MEAN stack had a relevant role: both Backend and Frontend developers could start to work on the other side using the same
programming language (in this case Javascript, and Typescript later). Its popularity put even more emphasis on the term “Stack”.

Now that we've given a bit of an overview of Full Stack's common meaning, let's go gradually to the point.

## Versatility is a skill, not a requirement

Nowadays, it’s appreciated to have knowledge for being able to touch different parts of the systems, the so-called Full Stack skills,
and it’s definitely something important because you can help your team in many ways, and you can better understand the
entire cycle of your product having a more clear picture of the processes.

Anyway being a good developer isn't a synonym for "Developer who knows everything". <br />
Who decides if you are a good developer? <br />

You could work on Frontend, Backend, or Infrastructure without being involved in the others branches of engineering,
excelling in your specific field. Wouldn't you be good enough?

That's my honest and personal opinion: an engineer who is great in his/her field without a lot of knowledge of the others
is not better than an Engineer who can touch everything but with mediocre skills in everything.

Why?

It's all about QUALITY.

## The importance of focusing

I've always been a Backend person since university.
The first time I touched a Frontend framework during my first working experience I started to have an interest in Front End
development.

In that period I felt like someone that is looking for a certain genre of movie to watch on his favorite streaming platform,
and scrolling through the list he changes continuously idea being temporary attracted by the proposals but every time not enough
for clicking the play button.
Every time I started to go deeper into a technology, a type of architecture, or whatever there was something else fascinating that
kept my attention, and I changed my plans.

During my study time, I was confused about what to study and after finishing a course or some basic beginner project
I jumped to another topic that often wasn't even much related.<br />
I didn't go into every topic well because I was more interested in knowing a bit of everything.
That's perfect for learning many things, but I noticed that I was struggling to keep up with the technologies, concepts,
approaches, etc. in every single sector, and you know... our field is huge, full of new technologies that are born every day.

I think it's quite impossible to be a person who knows everything really well.<br />
I'm not saying that no one can do it: for sure
the Diego Armando Maradona or the Einstein of the situation exists in every field, but it's not the rule!

### "Focus, Focus... Focus!"

![Figure 3](focus.jpg "Focus")

I decided at a certain point to focus more on what I liked and that was more akin to my attitude, and Backend, without
precluding the joy of learning and touching also Frontend, DevOps stuff, and so on...

I'm going on with this approach even today.<br />
At this specific period for example I’m learning a lot of “DevOps-related things" and sometimes even some Frontend concept
working with my Team thanks also to more expert colleagues in those fields, but I continue to consider myself a
“Software Engineer focused on the Backend dark side with a strong interest in learning even non-Backend things when useful
and possible” but with clear priorities :smile:.

Focusing on something and setting yourself clear goals is the best way to improve the quality of what you do
because investing more time in it will allow you to build your experience on what you choose, improving day by day and
keeping up with its evolution. <br />
This is not valid only in Software Engineering.

If you are even able to improve in other fields is for sure a great value, but it should be considered a plus that makes you more
flexible and valuable, not the main goal that makes you lose your specialization.

## So what’s the problem behind Full Stack Engineering?

The problem is not the person's interest in being more versatile, but it's the companies' approach to that, which
leads developers to think that the important thing is to know a little of everything, for being more desirable on the market,
losing the focus on their own specialization.

It happens that Companies look for Full Stack Engineers, in order to hire fewer people who will have more responsibilities in different
parts of the system.
Sometimes they give less importance to one role over another, underestimating the impact of not having specialised people on the product.
The reason is quite simple: it's cheaper.

Yes, it's true, that's an economical advantage initially. But what does often happen after some time?<br />
As the applications grow, there will be more functionalities, many of them will change, and the complexity will change.
The initial choice will become probably a costly choice in the future because each part of the system was designed with
less experience and care compared to what a specialised engineer would have.

It’s a quality choice, and the lack of quality of a product will make its maintenance and its evolution more expensive in the future.

When a company only hires “Full Stack Engineers”, I hear a bell ringing right away. <br />
At least it is worth asking a few questions about the reasons behind the choice. :smile:

## Conclusion

I believe in focusing on a field with the attitude to develop other skills as an added value,
not in knowing everything superficially without clear goals.

I believe in "Full Stack skills" as something that completes you, not in Full Stack Engineering as an all-in-one field or
as a role.
